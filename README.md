# build_neural_net
Writing a basic neural network for better understanding. 

Uses the iris dataset from sklearn. 

Ignored the biases for the purposes of simplicity. 

Neural network is composed of inputs (data you want to fit) and weights and biases, resulting in an output value. 
The neural network is 'trained' by feedforward propogation, and backpropagation to update the weights of the connecting nodes. 

For small scale networks this can be coded up manually. 

For anything else tools like keras, tensorflow, pytorch are highly recommended.
